# Getting started

1. Create a file named `config.json`.
2. Edit `config.json` and fill in your username and password like this:

```
{
  "username": "your-onyen",
  "password": "your-onyen-password"
}
```

Then, run `node grade` to get your grade or `node availability` to check which courses in your shopping cart are available.

Note that `node grade` is not available at the moment.
